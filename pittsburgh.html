                   Pittsburgh has a lot of navigable waterways which contain rich amounts of natural resources such as coal, timber, natural gas, iron, and limestone. Even in the early days of the city there were major events that shaped the modern United States. These events include the whiskey rebellion in 1791 and had underground railroad stops in the 1860’s. After these times an immigrant named Andrew Carnegie came to Pittsburgh and brought with him the Bessemer steel making process. This steel allowed for production of larger bridges, railroads, skyscrapers, and ships and other high-pressure and high tensile strength machinery. In 1875 Carnegie began producing this steel for the US. In 1901 Carnegie along with Henry Frick merged several companies and created the United Steel Corporation. The company had it’s troubles with it’s work conditions and caused events like the Homestead Steel Strike and the Battle of Homestead. In the 1950s Pittsburgh was the nation’s eight largest city and is responsible for almost half of the national steel output. Before Carnegie’s death he made several generous public contributions such as Carnegie Library, Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh, and the Carnegie Institute of Technology (also known as Carnegie Mellon University). Later in the 1970’s and 80’s the city experience financial hard times when the steel production pretty much disappeared.

            <h2>The Whiskey Rebellion</h2>

                <p>During the aftermath of the American Revolution, individual states found themselves burdened with substantial debt. In 1790, Alexander Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, proposed a federal takeover of state debts and introduced a tax on whiskey as a means to generate much-needed revenue. This decision stirred unrest among the people, particularly in Pennsylvania. George Washington, the first President of the United States, sought the opinions of local leaders in Pennsylvania and Virginia before passing the whiskey tax bill. Almost immediately, protests erupted, fueled by claims that the tax disproportionately favored larger whiskey producers, leaving smaller ones burdened with higher taxes.
                As tensions escalated, small producers began to resist paying the tax. The government responded by dispatching officials to collect the taxes, leading to a series of confrontations between the authorities and the rebelling citizens. The breaking point occurred on September 11, 1791, when an excise officer was surrounded by 11 men. In a brutal act, they stripped him naked, tarred and feathered him, stole his horse, and abandoned him in the forest. Two men were identified, and warrants were issued for their arrest. In response to the escalating violence, President Washington assembled a militia of more than 12,000 men and sent them to quell the rebellion. However, upon their arrival, the rebels had already dispersed, and the confrontation resulted in minimal violence. Following the unsuccessful attempt to collect taxes and the general difficulty in enforcing the law, the federal government repealed the whiskey tax in 1802. The Whiskey Rebellion had exposed the challenges of imposing taxes and enforcing laws in a young and diverse nation.</p>
