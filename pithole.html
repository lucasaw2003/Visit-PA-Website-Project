                <p>Region: The North-western; Cornplanter Township in Vanango County</p>

                <p>The town of Pithole was founded in 1865 near modern day Titusville. This was the site of the first commercial oil well, Drake Oil Well. This caused the town’s population to boom to 20,000 due to the prosperity of the oil. A lot of the oil field workers and teamsters made large sums of money extracting and shipping the oil out in barrels. The town was known to have bars attached to most commercial building. Soon the first oil pipeline was also invented here by Samuel Van Syckel. This caused a subsequent “pipeline war” with the current teamsters who would come in and wreck the pipeline at nigh. This occurred until the pinkertons were brought in to guard it at night. In 1866 the price of oil crashed and dropped the population down to 2,000. after everyone left the land was sold back to Venango County for $4.37 in 1878. It grew weeds until 1957 when a Titusville publisher bought it brushed it up and donated it to the state. Today the town serves as a visitor center and there are guided tours offered there over the summer weekends.</p>

                <p>The Drake Oil was the first practical oil recover system and is located in Titusville and the excavation for the well dates back to the 1500s. Even though it dates back to the 1500s it was not explored until the 1800s. In 1850 when it was first in production it generated 18 gallons a day excavating oil off surface pools. The investors that owned the well brought in Drake to improve the efficiency. When he came he struck oil only 69 feet down and managed to yield 1,000 gallons per day for 3 years. In 1865 the area found oil prospectors flock coming to seek their fortunes and by 1866 they exported their first shipment of oil.</p>
