                <p>The capital city of Pennsylvania is the city of Harrisburg which was founded in 1785 and became the capital of Pennsylvania in 1812. The city of Harrisburg includes Steelton, Paxtang, Penbrook, Colonial Park, Linglestown, Hershey, Middletown, Camp Hill, Lemoyne, New Cumberland, Mechanicsburg, West Fairview, and Enola. The area was first inhabited in 1705 when the owners received a license to trade with the Susquehanna Native Americans living in the area at the time. It was first established as a trading post and ferry service by an Englishman named John Harris. The settlement that first existed was named Louisbourg after King Louis XVI of France. In 1785 is was then named Harrisburg by William Maclay in honor of John Harris. In the 1830’s and 1840’s it developed into a major transportation center in Pennsylvania. The events that contributed to this development includes the opening of the Pennsylvania Canal (1834), The introduction of the first railroad train (1836), and the completion of the Pennsylvania railroad (1847). To this day Harrisburg continues to be a transportation hub for the state of Pennsylvania.</p>
