                <p>Pennsylvania was one of the original 13 colonies in America and was founded by William Penn to serve as a safe haven for him and his fellow Quakers. The first capital of the state was Philadelphia which was the site of the first (1774) and second (1775) continental congress. During the second continental congress the Declaration of Independence was born. It was also the second state to ratify the US constitution, after Delaware. During the civil war it was the site of the Battle of Gettysburg and the Gettysburg address given by the famous President Lincoln. In modern times there are many historical sites you can visit such as the liberty bell and independence hall.</p>
